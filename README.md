🚗 Smart Roadside Assistance System
📌 Overview

The Smart Roadside Assistance System is an intelligent mobile application designed to simplify emergency vehicle support. Instead of navigating complex menus, users can simply describe their problem using voice or text. The system automatically understands the issue, identifies the user’s location, finds the nearest service center, and assigns an available mechanic for quick dispatch.

This solution focuses on speed, automation, and user convenience, ensuring faster roadside help during critical situations.

🎯 Problem Statement

Traditional roadside assistance systems require multiple manual steps such as selecting service categories and entering location details. This causes delays during emergencies.
